"Causal Inference in R
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

In this workshop, we'll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting.


In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally. In this workshop, we'll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We'll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools. You'll be able to use the tools you already know–the tidyverse, regression models, and more–to answer the questions that are important to your work.


This course is for you if you:

know how to fit a linear regression model in R,

have a basic understanding of data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse tools, and

are interested in understanding the fundamentals behind how to move from estimating correlations to causal relationships.

"Effective Data Visualization with ggplot2
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

The R programming language provides powerful primitives for data visualization. In particular, for many data scientists the package ggplot2 is the go-to toolkit for making visualizations. Through its modular and extensible design, ggplot2 has mushroomed into a formidable ecosystem, and with the aid of third-party extension packages there is little in terms of data visualization that cannot be done with ggplot2 these days. However, harnessing this flexibility and power can present a steep learning curve. While most users can quickly throw together a scatter plot or histogram, turning the initial figure draft into a carefully designed, publication-ready visualization requires a much deeper understanding of how ggplot2 functions.


This workshop has two complementary goals. First, you will learn useful tips and tricks for ggplot2 that will help you make plots that look stylish, unique, and exactly the way you want them to. This will include strategies for layering geoms, customizing coordinate systems and scales, tweaking the plot theme and other aspects of the plot appearance, and creating annotations. Second, you will learn some fundamental principles of figure design. These will include principles for choosing color palettes and for designing for color-vision deficiency, as well as some general principles of communication and design for accessibility.


This course is for you if you:

have some prior experience with ggplot2 and the tidyverse

want to learn how to tweak and fine-tune plot designs in ggplot2

want to learn more about how to choose colors and how to design for accessibility

Flavors of the Pharmaverse
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

Over the past 4 years, the pharmaverse was created and has blossomed into a booming community of organizations and package developers aimed at supporting R development with focus on the clinical reporting pipeline. Even within a world as standardized as regulatory submissions, organizations still tend to have sometimes vastly different requirements within their own processes.

In this workshop, we’ll give a high level overview of the scope and tools available within the pharmaverse for the clinical pipeline, including tools for ADaM data set curation, creating Analysis Results Data Sets, and TLGs. To help attendees understand how there are different paradigms and pathways through the pharmaverse, we’ll take a tour through two to three different strategies available to support table, listing, and figure creation. Attendees of this workshop will walk away with an understanding of how the pharmaverse can help their organization and where they can look to learn more about the right tools to support their needs.

"Making Tables with gt and Great Tables
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

The gt package for R and the Great Tables package for Python both deal with an important element of written communication: tables. We don’t believe tables have to be drab or dull. Rather, we think that tables have the power to inspire and to excite!

In this workshop, you’ll learn about how to make tables that can accurately convey information yet look aesthetically pleasing. We will handle the first stumbling block: what do we even call the different parts of a table? After getting the table terminology down we’ll learn how to effectively assemble the table components and create powerful displays of information. We will start simply and progressively, working toward more complex table designs. Since there are two packages (one in R, one in Python) we will take a blended approach and learn about table generation in bilingual fashion.



We’ll cover the following:

Create table components and put them together (e.g., header, footer, stub, etc.)
Format cell values (numeric/scientific, date/datetime, etc.)
Rearranging columns and handling column value alignments
Styling the table, either through data values or on a more granular level
Adding icons, plots, images, and incorporating your own HTML
more!

"Package Development: The Rest of the Owl
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package, containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data. Putting R code in a package is the best way to share our code with others or to share code across different projects. This workshop assumes you've already dipped your toe in package development, i.e. that you've managed to create a basic package and pass R CMD check. In terms of ""How to draw an owl,"" you've definitely drawn some circles. But now it's time to draw the rest of the owl!


You will learn workflows and skills that are (a) very important for package development and (b) very different from writing R scripts. We will lean heavily on the tools and principles used by the tidyverse team, embodied in the devtools family of packages, including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.


The exact topics won't be finalized until closer to conf, but they are likely to be drawn from this list:

Fundamental daily workflows: devtools::load_all() and check()
Documentation: function documentation, vignettes, and website
Dependencies and namespaces: how to use other packages in yours and how to distinguish the parts of your package that are internal vs. external
Testing: the testthat package and the philosophy of writing tests as you go (vs. “later”)
Debugging: beyond print statements
Data: internal data vs. data available to your user

It is likely we will reserve a chunk of time late in the day for you to apply something you’ve learned to your own package(s). This is a good chance to talk things through with members of the tidyverse team. This will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will be using the RStudio IDE to work through the materials.


This course is for you if you:

Are very comfortable writing R scripts and functions.
Have already created a basic package, e.g., you’ve successfully worked through The Whole Game chapter from R Packages or have equivalent experience.
Have concrete plans for one or more specific packages you want to create. You might have even started implementing these plans.
Are interested in using devtools/RStudio for package development.
Are at least curious about Git/GitHub. We won’t have time to teach this explicitly, but you will certainly see Git/GitHub through out the day.

"R in Production
Monday, Aug 129:00 AM - 5:00 PM PDT

What it means to put R in production varies tremendously from organisation to organisation. However, I believe that there are common principles that you can learn to improve your code, regardless of the precise details of what production means for your organisation.


This workshop is organised around three big differences between running a local script on your computer and putting your code into production:

Not just once: production code isn’t a one-off script; it runs repeatedly, and needs to run reliably even as the environment around it (e.g. R package versions and input data) changes. How can you ensure that code continues to run reliably months and years after you wrote it, and when there’s a problem it clearly reports on it.
Not just your computer: production code doesn’t run on your computer. It typically runs on some other server where you can’t interactively experiment. This poses particular challenges for authentication and debugging.
Not just you: the responsibility for production code is typically shared across a team. How can you ensure that you’re all working together as effectively as possible, sharing code and best practices, and continuing to get better at your job over time.

This course is for you if you:

Get frustrated debugging R code that’s running on another computer.

Struggle keep your code running reliably as packages and data change over time.

Want to generally improve the quality of your production code.

As we embark on a journey to weave R and Python into the fabric of our organization, let's keep these insights and strategies at the forefront. Together, we can redefine what it means to be adaptable and resilient in an ever-changing world.


A New Era for Shiny-based Clinical Submissions using WebAssembly - Eric Nantz
In life sciences, Shiny has enabled tremendous innovations to produce web interfaces as front-ends to sophisticated analyses, interactive visualizations, and clinical reporting. While industry sponsors have widely adopted Shiny, a relatively unexplored frontier has been the inclusion of a Shiny application inside a submission package to the FDA. The R Consortium R-Submissions Working Group has continued the momentum of previous submission pilots, such as the successful Shiny app submission to FDA in 2023. In this talk, I will share the journey of how we used containers and WebAssembly for a new and innovative approach to sharing a Shiny application directly with the FDA, paving the way for new innovation in the clinical submission process.


Open-Source Initiatives in Pharma - What's Out There and Why You Should Join - Nicholas Masel
The pharmaceutical industry has come a long way when it comes to using open-source and collaborating on initiatives to solve complex industry issues. The number of initiatives and working groups that are now available have grown so much over the last 5 to 10 years that understanding what to join, or even just what to keep track of, can feel like selecting an R package, you’ve got a lot of options! This is a good problem to have, but it can also feel like a barrier to entry for companies or individuals in the industry who are looking to learn and/or contribute. In this talk, I will present guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to help them navigate the open-source collaboration landscape to help companies and individuals get involved.

Machine Learning And Statistical Modeling
Tuesday, Aug 1310:20 AM - 11:40 AM PDT

Making sense of marginal effects - Demetri Pananos
The marginaleffects package for R and python offers a single point of entry to easily interpret over 100 types of models using a simple and consistent interface. Marginaleffects has become an indispensable tool for moving away from tables of regression coefficients and towards easily interpretable and estimates. In addition to making regression models more interpretable, marginaleffects offers flexible plotting tools, efficient implementations, validated results against Stata, and a thoroughly documented website abundant with examples and vignettes.


This talk is for data scientists and data analysts who analyze data with regression models. We’ll cover how to estimate and visualize a variety of effect summaries with marginaleffects.


Understanding, Generating, and Evaluating Prediction Intervals - Bryan Shalloway
For many problems concerning prediction, providing intervals is more useful than just offering point estimates. This talk will provide an overview of:

How to think about uncertainty in your predictions (e.g. noise in the data vs uncertainty in estimation)
Approaches to producing prediction intervals (e.g. parametric vs conformal)
Measures and considerations when evaluating and training models for prediction intervals


While I will touch on some similar topics as Max Kuhn’s posit::conf(2023) talk on conformal inference, my talk will cover different points and have a broader focus. I hope attendees gain an understanding of some of the key tools and concepts related to prediction intervals and that they leave inspired to learn more.


Keras 3: Deep Learning made easy - Tomasz Kalinowski
Keras 3 is a ground-up rewrite of Keras 2, keeping everything that was already great the same, while refining and simplifying parts of the API based on lessons accumulated over the past few years. Come to this talk to learn about all the features (new and old) in Keras that make it easy to build, train, evaluate and deploy deep learning models.


Quality Control to avoid GIGO in Deep Learning Models - Vasant Marur
Deep Learning models help answer scientific questions, but they are only as accurate as the data we feed them. To ensure accurate models, we can implement quality control (QC) methods to ensure only high quality data is used in training these models. Scientists generate thousands of images as part of Image-Based High Content Screening assays. To help them quickly assess the quality of these images before considerable time is spent analyzing them, we developed an interactive tool using Shiny that displays which images were flagged as part of QC. In this talk, I’ll explain how we created this QC tool and share ideas on how you could leverage your existing code and turn it into a stand alone web app your stakeholders can use.

Navigating A Career In Data Science
Tuesday, Aug 1310:20 AM - 11:40 AM PDT

Beyond the Classroom: Unspoken Realities of a Data Science Career - Brandon Sucher

Embarking on a data science career extends well beyond academic knowledge. In many ways, the learning has just begun. Soft skills have become increasingly valuable, with effective collaboration being essential for success. Additionally, there may be moments when advocating for your own work is crucial, turning data scientists into persuasive salespeople for their own insights and contributions. In this talk, I'll touch on some of the aspects of a data science job that aren't talked about as frequently, including onboarding successfully, becoming a subject matter expert, and understanding the end-to-end data workflow.


GitHub: How To Tell Your Professional Story - Abigail Haddad

GitHub is more than just a version control tool, it's a way of explaining your professional identity to prospective employers and collaborators – and you can build your profile now, before you're looking for new opportunities. This talk is about how to think of GitHub as an opportunity, not a chore, and how to represent yourself well without making developing your GitHub profile into a part-time job. I'll talk about why GitHub adds value beyond a personal website, what kinds of projects are helpful to share, and some good development practices to get in the habit of, regardless of your project specifics.


Getting Data Done with a Pragmatic Data Team - Alan Schussman

Data work comes in lots of forms, and large organizations with reliable pipelines of similar problems can be very specialized in how they tackle this work. My contention is that many organizations doing data work don't get to be so picky: Instead of specialized roles in focused parts of a data process, many of us work from end to end, and projects often differ in the tools and domain knowledge they require. Identifying and making use of good, reusable practices in this environment is hard, and there's not a consistent supply of some of the work that's most appealing to ambitious data people. This talk explores some successes and failures in building flexible, effective, empowered teams in this environment.


Oops I'm A Manager - Finding your Minimal Viable Process - Andrew Holz

In today's fast-paced, data-driven landscape, transitioning to a leadership role can be daunting. This talk is designed for emerging data team leaders, offering insights into striking the right balance between a clear effective process and the flexibility required for team members to do their best work. It emphasizes the importance of iterative process design, establishing effective feedback loops, and empowering team members with autonomy. These key strategies put into action as team habits provide a blueprint for an adaptable workflow relevant to a range of different organizations. The talk aims to create a framework where both efficiency and creativity can thrive together.

Beautiful And Effective Tables
Tuesday, Aug 131:00 PM - 2:20 PM PDT

Adequate Tables? No, We Want Great Tables - Richard Iannone
Tables are great, and we’ve been doing a lot on both the R and Python sides to make it possible to generate aesthetically pleasing tables. The gt package for R has been under continuous development for six years and there is still so many things we can do to make it better. Great Tables, our new Python package, brings beautiful tables to Python users and provides an API that’s in tune with that ecosystem.

While we have made great strides and unlocked new table-making possibilities for our users, our ambitions are huge! So, we’d like to show you the state of things on this front and also where we intend to go with our collective table efforts.


Context is King - Shannon Pileggi
The quality of data science insights is predicated on the practitioner’s understanding of the data. Data documentation is the key to unlocking this understanding; with minimal effort, this documentation can be natively embedded in R data frames via variable labels. Variable labels seamlessly provide valuable data context that reduces human error, fosters collaboration, and ultimately elevates the overall data analysis experience. As an avid, daily user of variable labels, I am excited to help you discover new workflows to create and leverage variable labels in R!


gtsummary: Streamlining Summary Tables for Research and Regulatory Submissions - Daniel Sjoberg
The gtsummary R package empowers researchers and analysts to create publication-ready summary tables efficiently. Developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, it quickly gained traction and has become the most downloaded package for summary tables on CRAN. 2024 marked a significant expansion for gtsummary. A comprehensive codebase update enhanced performance and introduced new features. Further, the adoption of CDISC’s Analysis Results Data standard enables compliance with emerging FDA submissions standards, maintaining relevance for various research and regulatory needs. gtsummary offers a robust solution for generating clear, informative tables, saving time and ensuring quality for researchers and analysts across diverse fields.


Stitch by Stitch: The Art of Engaging New Users - Becca Krouse
In the world of crochet, the Woobles kit simplifies yarn, hooks, and stitches for beginners, alleviating decision fatigue and fostering early success. This model unexpectedly extends to the domain of R. Newcomers, especially in industries less familiar to open-source, may find mastering new tools daunting. We grappled with this while developing {tfrmt}, a table-making package for pharma. This talk will draw parallels with crochet to explore strategies for engaging and retaining new users. Attendees will grasp the role of a starter kit for easing the learning curve and the value of nurturing experts with transferable skills. They'll glean insights to support their own audiences, whether in creating an R package or crafting a cuddly unicorn.

Strengthening The R Ecosystem
Tuesday, Aug 131:00 PM - 2:20 PM PDT

20+ Years of Reading Data into R - Colin Gillespie
For the last 20+ years, I've been reading data into R. It all started with the humble scan() function. Then, I used fancy new-fangled file formats, such as parquet and arrow, before progressing onto trendy databases, such as duckdb, for analytics. Besides the fun you can have by messing around with new technologies, when should you consider the above formats? In this talk, I'll cover a variety of methods for importing data and highlight the good, the bad, and the annoying.


Contributing to the R Project - Heather Turner
Posit provides an amazing set of products to support data science, and we will learn about many great packages and approaches from both Posit and the wider community at posit::conf(2024). But underlying it all are a number of open source tools, notably R and Python. How can we contribute to sustaining these open source projects, so that we can continue to use and build on them?

In this talk I will address this question in the context of the R project. I will give an overview of the ways we can contribute as individuals or companies/organizations, both financially and in kind. Together we can build a more sustainable future for R!


What I Learned Resurrecting an R package - Dave Slager
We hear a lot about creating R packages, but R packages don't last forever on their own. I describe my experience resurrecting rvertnet, an abandoned ropensci project that had become stale on CRAN. I talk about how I found out the package needed a new maintainer, how I took ownership of the package, and how I decided what needed fixing. I discuss several examples of package repairs I implemented, including fixing outdated CI, removing unnecessary files and dependencies, writing workarounds for deprecated functions, and fixing building of a vignette. Finally, I'll describe my positive experiences communicating with the old maintainer and submitting a package to CRAN for the first time.


Building Sustainable Open Source Ecosystems: Lessons From the #rstats Community and an NSF Grant - Kelly Bodwin
The blessing and the curse of open-source software is that it lacks the infrastructure of a corporation. It can often be difficult to ensure that projects have stability and longevity. In this talk, I will discuss ongoing work on an NSF ""Pathways in Open-Source Ecosystems"" grant focused on the {data.table} package. Like many R packages, {data.table} has incredible functionality and thousands of users - but no cohesive community or governance structure to support it long-term. We are working to build this ecosystem. I will provide my advice and insight for key aspects of a sustainable open-source project: Engaging casual users, supporting developers, generating content, emphasizing education, and creating a home base for the community.

What's New With Tidymodels?
Tuesday, Aug 131:00 PM - 2:20 PM PDT

Fair machine learning - Simon Couch
In recent years, high-profile analyses have called attention to many contexts where the use of machine learning deepened inequities in our communities. After a year of research and design, the tidymodels team is excited to share a set of tools to help data scientists develop fair machine learning models and communicate about them effectively. This talk will introduce the research field of machine learning fairness and demonstrate a fairness-oriented analysis of a machine learning model with tidymodels.


Survival analysis is coming to tidymodels! - Hannah Frick
Survival analysis is a part of statistical modeling (and machine learning) specifically for time-to-event data. This is common in medical research but has broad applications across industries, e.g. for analyzing customer churn. The tidymodels framework is a collection of R packages for safe, performant, and expressive predictive modeling. We added models for survival analysis a while ago. Now we are back with the rest, including performance metrics specifically for these types of models. I'd like to show how you can now leverage the entire framework for survival analysis: for all steps of the modeling process, from data prep to tuning. We are so excited to show you all of this!


Evaluating Censored Regression Models is Hard - Max Kuhn
Censoring in data can frequently occur when we have a time-to-event. For example, if we order a pizza that has not yet arrived after 5 minutes, it is censored; we don't know the final delivery time, but we know it is at least 5 minutes. Censored values can appear in clinical trials, customer churn analysis, pet adoption statistics, or anywhere a duration of time is used. I'll describe different ways to assess models for censored data and focus on metrics requiring an evaluation time (i.e., how well does the model work at 5 minutes?). I'll also describe how you can use tidymodel's expanded features for these data to tell if your model fits the data well. This talk is designed to be paired with the other tidymodels talk by Hannah Frick


Tidypredict with recipes, turn workflow to SQL, spark, duckdb and beyond - Emil Hvitfeldt
Tidypredict is one of my favorite packages. Being able to turn a fitted model object into an equation is very powerful! However in tidymodels, we use recipes more and more to do preprocessing. So far, tidypredict didn’t have support for recipes, which severely limited its uses. This talk is about how I fixed that issue. Spending a couple of years thinking about this problem, I finally found a way! Being able to turn a tidymodels workflow into a series of equations for prediction is super powerful. For some uses, being able to turn a model to predict inside SQL, spark or duckdb allows us to handle some problems with more ease.

Automated Reporting With Quarto: Beyond Copy And Paste
Tuesday, Aug 132:40 PM - 4:00 PM PDT


Reclaiming My Time with Quarto: A Journey from WordPress to Simplicity - Tyler Morgan-Wall
Tired of WordPress's endless updates and security headaches? Want to spend less time on server administration and more time with friends and family? I found freedom by switching to Quarto with R's help! I'll show how I used R to automate the transformation of complex WordPress sites—custom JavaScript, styles, and content—into clean Quarto markdown. Additionally, I'll demonstrate how I enhanced my site using Quarto, and how switching has vastly improved my publishing workflow. This talk will show attendees how this decision can streamline and improve your blog or website: enhancing speed, improving security, and minimizing site management.


Beyond Dashboards: Dynamic Data Storytelling with Python, R, and Quarto Emails - Sean Nguyen
In this talk, I’ll confront the traditional dependence on dashboards for business intelligence, pointing out their shortcomings in delivering prompt insights to business professionals. I will propose a shift in strategy that employs Python and R to generate dynamic, customized emails, utilizing Quarto and Posit Connect for seamless automation. This technique guarantees direct and effective delivery of actionable insights to users' inboxes, enhancing informed decision-making and boosting engagement. This recommendation not only redefines the method of data delivery for optimal impact but also prompts a fundamental change in mindset among data practitioners, urging them towards a more engaged and individualized form of data narration.


Creating Reproducible Static Reports - Orla Doyle
In clinical trials we work in interdisciplinary teams where the discussion of outputs is often facilitated using static documents. We wanted to bring the advantages of modern tools (R, markdown, git) and software development practices to the production of company documents. We used an object-oriented approach to create classes for report items with a suite of tests. Finally, the report is rendered programmatically in docx format using a company template. This enables our statisticians to work in a truly end to end fashion within a GxP environment with the end product in a format suitable for interdisciplinary collaboration. We are currently piloting this package internally before we release in the open-source community.


Quarto: A Multifaceted Publishing Powerhouse for Medical Researchers - Joshua Cook
Traditional medical research dissemination is slow and cumbersome, often culminating in a diverse array of outputs: reports for our sponsors and regulators, manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals, summaries for online platforms, and presentations for conferences. However, it takes a great deal of time and effort to organize all these outputs so that our findings can enter the patient setting. Quarto can change that. It's a tool that lets us efficiently create various polished formats from a single source, while meeting diverse submission requirements. This talk will showcase how Quarto can revolutionize our communication, making research more impactful and speeding up the delivery of treatments to our patients.

I’d like to talk about the work my team does to develop user-friendly Shiny applications that look and feel like full websites and share some of the tools we use. This includes things like designing landing pages, creating detailed “About” pages, letting users share links to specific charts or download static versions, adding social media sharing links, site meta tags, and sub-URLs, and so much more. After attending this talk, I hope others are excited about leveraging tools to make their users say “Wait, that’s Shiny?”


Shiny Templates - Greg Swinehart
The Shiny team has been working to help apps' UI and UX scale more thoughtfully and elegantly. We are currently working on Shiny Templates, which are opinionated boilerplate code that bring our refreshed component library and layouts together to help users create small, simple apps or large, complicated, multi-page dashboards that just look right.


Making an App a System - Mike Stackhouse
What data processing in your Shiny app is redundant or must happen within the app at all? What makes Shiny beautiful is how it blends data visualization into a compact bundle of code. That said, there are challenges to overcome to get from a developer’s console to users’ screens. Tools like Posit Connect help with this process, but as an app matures, developers and their users may encounter different performance issues. To address this, sometimes this means evolving and introducing separate data pipelines. In this presentation, we will overview some different types of scaling issues for a Shiny app. Additionally, we will introduce the new package {matte}, which provides support for adding data pipelines to your app that live outside Shiny.


Empowering Decisions: Advanced Portfolio Analysis and Management through Shiny - Lovekumar Patel
This talk explores the creation of an advanced portfolio analysis system using Shiny and Plumber API. Focused on delivering real-time insights and interactive tools, the system transforms financial analysis with user-centric design and reusable Shiny modules. The talk will delve into how complex financial data is made dynamic and interactive via an internal R package integrating with an ag-grid javascript library to enhance user engagement and decision-making efficiency. A highlight is the Plumber API's dual role: powering the current system and hosting other enterprise applications in other languages (python), demonstrating remarkable cross-platform integration. This system exemplifies the innovative potential of R in financial analytics.

Making Decisions With Data
Tuesday, Aug 132:40 PM - 4:00 PM PDT

Democratizing Organization Surveys with Quarto and Shiny - Brennan Antone
When gathering data from groups (e.g., surveys), where does it go, and who does it help? How do we consider the privacy of respondents and power dynamics in who can access and benefit from data?

In this talk, I describe the creation of tools to let respondents get personalized feedback from the data they provide. This shifts the balance of power, allowing everyone to benefit directly, rather than providing information to only top decision-makers. I examine how Quarto and Shiny enable the creation of such tools, and describe takeaways from implementing them with two Fortune 500 companies. This talk teaches how personalized tools can make data accessible to all, and how to alter the power dynamics of how organizations gather and use data.

Data Contracts: Keep Your Weekend Work-Free! - Nick Pelikan

This talk will discuss data contracts – agreements between data producers and data consumers that ensure data is always available in the expected form. We'll delve into processes and techniques I've developed that can help teams easily create data contracts. This talk will also introduce a literate programming framework that can enable data producers and data consumers who work on different teams, in completely different programming languages (or no programming language at all!) to collaborate on creating data contracts, and allow them to be enforced automatically.


Demystifying Data Modeling - Kshitij Aranke

Data Modeling – what is it, why is it useful, and how dbt makes it easy.

As a previous R user, I was very skeptical of the value of data modeling when I first came across it. But over time, I realized that it helped organizations scale up analytics practices by standardizing on consistent definitions for metrics, improving debuggability for data pipelines, and even enabling rapid experimentation. I want to share this magic with the posit::conf community, and especially how dbt is a tool that's oriented around this practice.


{mirai} and {crew}: next-generation async to supercharge {promises}, Plumber, Shiny, and {targets} - Charlie Gao and Will Landau

{mirai} is a minimalist, futuristic and reliable way to parallelise computations – either on the local machine, or across the network. It combines the latest scheduling technologies with fast, secure connection types. With built-in integration to {promises}, {mirai} provides a simple and efficient asynchronous back-end for Shiny and Plumber apps. The {crew} package extends {mirai} to batch computing environments for massively parallel statistical pipelines, e.g. Bayesian modeling, simulations, and machine learning. It consolidates tasks in a central {R6} controller, auto-scales workers, and helps users create plug-ins for platforms like SLURM and AWS Batch. It is the new workhorse powering high performance computing in {targets}.


Deploying data applications and documents to the cloud - Alex Chisholm

Creating engaging data content has never been easier, yet easily sharing remains a challenge. And that's the point, right? You cleaned the data, wrangled it, and summarized everything for others to benefit. But where do you put that final result? If you're still using R Markdown, perhaps it's rpubs.com. If you've adopted Quarto, it could be quartopub.com. Have a Jupyter notebook? Well, that's a different service. And this is just for docs. Want to deploy a streamlit app? Head to streamlit.io. Shiny? Log into shinyapps.io. Dash? You could use ploomber.io, if you have a docker file - and know what that is. This session summarizes the landscape for online data sharing and describes a new tool that Posit is working on to simplify your process.

What's New With Shiny For Python?
Wednesday, Aug 1410:20 AM - 11:40 AM PDT

Bending the Shiny learning curve with Shiny Express - Joe Cheng

Shiny Express is the easiest way to get started with Shiny. It's a new syntax for writing Shiny apps, one that trades structure for minimalism. It's designed to make Shiny dramatically easier to learn and faster to write, yet is still suitable for writing everything from throwaway prototypes, to realtime dashboards, to cutting edge model demos, to production-quality business workflow apps.

In this talk, I'll introduce the syntax of Shiny Express and compare and contrast it to the traditional way of writing Shiny apps (which we now refer to as Shiny Core).

I hope to inspire any R or Python data scientist who's been putting off learning Shiny, to finally give it a try!


Building ML and AI apps with Shiny for Python - Winston Chang

And our (forthcoming) API and R package enable users to seamlessly incorporate equity analytics into existing workflows and exciting new tools.

In this talk, I will share how we've expanded access to the tool using multi-language software. I'll discuss our updates to Python-based tool and API; R package wrapping the API; and Quarto-based documentation. I will also share how our partners in the City of Los Angeles have used the API and RShiny to build a custom budget equity tool.


Making Waves with R, Python, and Quarto - Regina Lionheart

Wave models are powerful tools for understanding coastal erosion, but analyzing their outputs pose challenges. Proprietary formats produce inaccessible data that require manual extraction. Final results must also be approachable to a diverse audience of engineers, governments, and coastal communities. In 2022, a project was proposed to investigate how a restored beach could respond to waves while mitigating erosion and protecting a cultural resource. Using R and Python wrapped in Quarto, wave model outputs were fully scripted to create a single reproducible document flexible enough to answer multiple modeling questions. As coasts change, rapid modeling and analysis may help preserve coastal access for years to come.


Why You Should Think Like an End-to-end Data Scientist, and How - Adam Wang

Machine learning (ML) solutions are becoming ubiquitous when tackling challenging problems, enabling end-users to access reliable, insightful information. However, many components of these solutions rely on domains outside traditional data science — e.g., data, DevOps, and software engineering.

In this talk, I'll walk through an end-to-end ML solution we built for transplant centers to identify likely stem cell donors. We'll then focus on how interacting with domains outside traditional data science can immensely help a project succeed and increase your impact.

You will take away specific examples on why thinking end-to-end can enhance your ML solutions, and how to start applying these principles at your own organization.

Data Wrangling for Advocacy: Tidy Data to Support the Affordable Connectivity Program - Christine Parker

We sought to create a dashboard to highlight some frequently asked statistics about the Affordable Connectivity Program. To accomplish this goal, I transformed the program data which consist of enrollment and claims summarized over different geographies and updated at different times (tidyverse); collected demographic data from the Census Bureau (tidycensus); modeled future enrollment and expenditure scenarios (lme4, plotly); and created geospatial datasets to illustrate our findings in maps (tigris, arcgisbinding). The messy datasets posed a steep learning curve. We were among the few organizations that worked with these data to translate them into meaningful insights and I'd like to share how we were able to create such a useful resource.

Novice to data scientist: how a pediatric anesthesiologist used R Studio to help disadvantaged kids access surgical care - Nick Pratap

When a surgical procedure gets cancelled, a child gains no health benefit, families' time off work and pre-op anxiety is in vain, and our not-for-profit children's hospital loses ~$1 per second. To understand cancellation, I needed to analyze thousands of patient records. Despite zero formal training, I learned to tidy then visualize data – and even do geocoding and machine learning. Once we identified children at high risk, we could target additional support to their families. Furthermore, we showed that surgery cancellation contributes to health inequality. The R Studio/tidyverse ecosystem allows novices to do sophisticated analytics, and is helping us improve access to health care for the most disadvantaged children in our communities.


A Machine Learning Approach to Protect Patients from Blood Tube Mix-Ups - Brendan Graham

A wrong blood in tube (WBIT) error occurs when blood collected from one patient is labeled as though it was collected from a different patient. While rare, these errors can cause serious, potentially life threatening patient safety events. This talk is about how a team of pathology informaticists and data scientists developed and deployed a multi-analyte WBIT detection model at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. We describe how machine learning models can potentially identify previously undetectable WBIT errors and improve upon the current detection methodology. Furthermore we demonstrate how using R markdown, tidymodels, vetiver and Posit Connect allowed for rapid model iteration, reproducibility, deployment and monitoring.
